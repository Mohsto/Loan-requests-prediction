# Loan-requests-prediction
The dataset used in this project contains information on individuals applying for loans, including demographic details (age, income, gender), loan-related attributes (loan amount, interest rate, loan intent), and financial status (credit score, homeownership). Using this data, the objective is to predict whether a loan will be approved or rejected.
